    <p>Hi, I'm Zach. I created Axe Charts to provide IATF Premier axe throwers with a more comprehensive view of their data than what <a target="_blank" href="https://axescores.com">Axe Scores</a> currently offers. Additionally, I added a few features that I thought the community might like. <a href="/rating-system">Axe Charts Rating (ACR)</a> is an alternative to the Collins Rating System (CRS) and <a href="/badges">Badges</a> are a way of providing some additional performance milestones apart from whether or not you've hit an 81.</p>
