    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p>Like in the IATF's Collins Rating System (CRS), a thrower's Axe Charts rating (ACR) is a way of summarizing their skill level in a single number. In both systems, a thrower is expected to win a match if their opponent has a lower rating.</p>

    <h2>Why was it made?</h2>

    <p>Axe throwing is an accuracy sport. While we do compete head-to-head, there's nothing you can do to force your opponent to lose. At the end of the day, accuracy wins matches. If your rating is meant to indicate whether you're expected to beat another thrower, then it should be based on your previous accuracy and not on the actions of your previous opponents.</p>

    <h2>How does it differ from CRS?</h2>

    <p>Your Collins rating is based on how well you perform in each round compared to how well you are expected to perform, while your Axe Charts rating is based on how accurately you throw. Let's look at a match between two hypothetical throwers: Alice and Bob. Alice is consistently very accurate while Bob is capable of high accuracy but is less consistent. In both rating systems, Alice has a higher rating than Bob. In the match, Alice throws three 25 point rounds and Bob throws a 21, 25, and 19.</p>

    <p>Since Alice has a higher CRS rating than Bob, she is expected to beat Bob in each round. In the match, Alice tied a round with Bob, won the match, but will still lose CRS points. Bob upset the expectation and gained points at Alice's expense. But Alice threw accurately and won the match, so why should her rating go down?</p>

    <p>In that same match, Alice would not lose ACR points just because Bob had a strong round. Instead, each thrower would gain or lose ACR points independently based on whether they threw better or worse than their averages. Bob cannot do anything in the match to affect Alice's rating. Both throwers' ratings are a reflection of their own skill level and a better indicator of their future success.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>Your Axe Charts rating is a reflection of your accuracy on both targets (bullseye and clutch) in both disciplines (hatchet and Big Axe). The rating value is the total points earned for all of your throws divided by the total points available - with one caveat. The basic idea is expressed in the simple formula below.</p>

    <p class="card no-wrap">ACR = Points Earned / Points Available</p>

    <p>This division produces a decimal number between 0 and 1. Multiplying this decimal number by 1000 makes it a 3 digit number (or 4 if your accuracy is perfect). The final rating value is that 3 digit number rounded to the nearest integer. These details are reflected in the updated formula below.</p>

    <p class="card no-wrap">ACR = Round(1000 * Points Earned / Points Available)</p>

    <p>Now let's talk about the one caveat. When clutch is called, technically the number of points available for that throw should be 7. However, adding 7 to the denominator of the formula would penalize throwers more for a missed clutch than for a dropped axe. Instead, the formula treats every throw as if there are only 5 points available. This way, a missed clutch incurs the same penalty as a dropped axe but a hit clutch awards an outsized benefit: gaining 7/5 available points instead of the 5/5 available points for a bullseye. The final form of the formula is shown below.</p>

    <p class="card no-wrap">ACR = Round((1000 * Total Points) / (5 * Total Throws))</p>

    <p>As an example, an 852 ACR value means that the thrower has earned 85.2% of all available points.</p>
