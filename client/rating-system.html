    <p>Like the IATF's Collins Rating System (CRS), the Axe Charts Rating (ACR) is intended to summarize an axe thrower's skill level with a single number. When comparing two throwers' ratings, the thrower with the higher number would be expected to win if they played a match. However, the ACR differs from CRS in a few key ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ACR measures accuracy while CRS measures match outcomes</li>
      <li>ACR is an absolute rating system while CRS is a relative rating system</li>
    </ul>
