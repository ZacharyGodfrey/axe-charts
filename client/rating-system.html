    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p>Like in the IATF's Collins Rating System (CRS), a thrower's Axe Charts Rating (ACR) is a way of summarizing their skill level in a single number. In both systems, a thrower is expected to win the match if they play against an opponent with a lower rating.</p>

    <h2>Why was it made?</h2>

    <p>Axe throwing is an accuracy sport. While we do compete head-to-head, there's nothing you can do to force your opponent to lose. At the end of the day, accuracy wins matches. If your rating is meant to indicate whether you're expected to beat another thrower, then it should be based on your previous accuracy and not on the actions of your previous opponents.</p>

    <h2>How does it differ from CRS?</h2>

    <p>Let's look at two hypothetical throwers: Alice and Bob. Alice is consistently very accurate while Bob is capable of high accuracy but is less consistent.</p>

    <p>Your Collins rating is based on how well you performed in each round compared to how well you were expected to perform. If Alice has a higher CRS rating than Bob, then Alice is expected to beat Bob in each round. This means that Alice can throw just as accurately as she always does, win the match, and still lose CRS points because Bob got lucky and happened to win or tie a single round. Bob upset the expectation and gained points at Alice's expense. But Alice threw accurately and won the match, so why should her rating go down?</p>

    <p>Your Axe Charts rating is based on how accurately you throw, so in our example Alice has a higher ACR value than Bob. In that same match, Alice would not lose ACR points just because Bob had a strong round. Instead, each thrower would gain or lose ACR points independently based on whether they threw better or worse than their averages. Bob cannot do anything in the match to affect Alice's rating. Both throwers' ratings are a reflection of their own skill level and a better indicator of their future success.</p>

    <p>To be clear, in both systems you can gain points and lose points regardless of whether you win or lose the match.</p>

    <p>Your Axe Charts rating is based on how accurately you throw. In the Axe Charts rating system, if you throw worse in a match that you usually do, then your rating will go down. If you throw better than you usually do, then your rating will go up. You could still lose ACR points for winning a match, but only because you were less accurate - not because your opponent did well. Similarly, you could gain ACR points even if you lose a match, but only because you threw well - not because your opponent had a bad day. Either way, your rating is a direct reflection of your skill alone and a better indicator of future success.</p>

    <p>As an example, let's look at two hypothetical throwers: Alice and Bob. Alice is a very accurate thrower who loses most of her matches by a narrow margin because she competes in a league with other highly skilled throwers. Bob is a less accurate thrower who wins most of his matches because he competes in a league with lower skilled throwers.</p>


    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>Your ACR value is a reflection of the number of points scored compared to the number of points available.</p>

    <h3>Accuracy vs Outcomes</h3>

    <p>Axe throwing is an accuracy sport. While we do compete head-to-head, it's your own accuracy that determines your success more than who you're competing against. If your rating number is meant to indicate whether you're expected to win or lose a match against another thrower, then that number should be based on how well you've previously thrown rather than whether you've won or lost.</p>

    <p>As an example, let's look at two hypothetical throwers: Alice and Bob. Alice is a very accurate thrower who loses most of her matches by a narrow margin because she competes in a league with other highly skilled throwers. Bob is a less accurate thrower who wins most of his matches because he competes in a league with lower skilled throwers.</p>

    <h3>Absolute Rating vs Relative Rating</h3>

    <p>In the Collins Rating System, your rating change after each match depends on the rating of your opponent. Because of this, ratings are relative to the pool of people you compete against. If you were rated 1450 back when it was rare for anyone to throw an 81, that would not be equal to someone being rated 1450 now that an 81 score is becoming increasingly common. The average skill level of the entire pool of throwers has gone up over time, so comparing ratings across time</p>
